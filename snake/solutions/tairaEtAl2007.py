"""
Implementation of the class `TairaEtAl2007` that contains the
steady-state force coefficients of an inclined flat-plate with aspect-ratio 2
at Reynolds number 100 for angles of attack between 0 and 90 degrees.

The force coefficient data files are located in the folder
`resources/validationData` of the snake package.
